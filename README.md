# Secure Real Time Multiplayer Game

Origin:

This is my implementation of the freeCodeCamp Secure Real Time Multiplayer Game. 
Instructions and example at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/information-security-projects/secure-real-time-multiplayer-game).
Forked from https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-secure-real-time-multiplayer-game)
Replit of my implementation: https://replit.com/@tomleidy/09-infosec-p05-sec-rt-mpgame

I focused primarily on a technical re-implementation of their example rather than creating a different game concept. 
The new concepts I learned in this project were primarily the HTML Canvas API and Socket.io.
