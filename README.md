# Secure Real Time Multiplayer Game

## Origin

This is my implementation of the freeCodeCamp Secure Real Time Multiplayer Game. The project instructions and example at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/information-security-projects/secure-real-time-multiplayer-game

## Forked from
The original GitHub my project was forked from is available at https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-secure-real-time-multiplayer-game)

## Playable implementation
For a prepared implementation: https://replit.com/@tomleidy/09-infosec-p05-sec-rt-mpgame

## My work
I focused primarily on a technical re-implementation of their example rather than creating a different game concept. 
The new concepts I learned in this project were primarily the HTML Canvas API and Socket.io.

## Icons
Icons are from https://game-icons.net/, a site I intend to use again for my personal gaming projects.
