# Secure Real Time Multiplayer Game: Avocado Home

## My work
This is my implementation of the freeCodeCamp Secure Real Time Multiplayer Game. I focused primarily on a technical re-implementation of the freeCodeCamp example rather than creating a different game concept. 
The new concepts I learned in this project were primarily the HTML Canvas API and Socket.io. If you'd like to see the diff of all the changes I made, a diff against commit 1342813cec7505827eac0f567db0b296c84b28db (the last freeCodeCamp commit before I cloned it)

## Icons
The collectible icons were chosen as references for Millennials: avocadoes, toast, a house, and cake.

Icons are from https://game-icons.net/, a site I intend to use again for my personal gaming projects.
